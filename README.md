# AI-Powered Teamwork Compatibility Checker

## 1. Project Overview
Hiring the right candidate is not just about technical skills—it’s about ensuring a good teamwork fit. Our AI-powered **Teamwork Compatibility Checker** helps HR teams and hiring managers match candidates with existing teams based on work styles, communication preferences, and cultural fit.

## 2. How It Works
Our system leverages AI to:
- Gather structured data from candidate questionnaires.
- Collect team member data for compatibility comparison.
- Store all data in a structured database.
- Identify top candidates based on compatibility.
- Generate an AI-powered dashboard with insights and visualizations.

## 3. Target Users
- **HR Professionals**: Ensure new hires align with team dynamics.
- **Hiring Managers**: Gain AI-driven insights into candidate-team collaboration potential.
- **Team Leads**: Improve internal hiring decisions based on compatibility analysis.

## 4. Key Features
### 4.1 AI-Powered Data Collection
- **Questionnaire Analysis**: AI processes candidate responses on:
  - Work style (structured vs. flexible)
  - Communication style (direct vs. indirect)
  - Preferred work environment (collaborative vs. independent)
  - Personality traits via AI-based analysis
- **Team Data Collection**: Team members provide their own questionnaire responses for compatibility matching.

### 4.2 AI-Driven Compatibility Matching
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Extracts personality and work style insights.
- **AI Personality Analysis**: Predicts personality traits and work preferences.
- **Database Storage**: Candidate and team data are stored for structured AI analysis.
- **Automated Matching**: AI ranks candidates based on compatibility with team dynamics.

### 4.3 AI-Powered Candidate Insights & Visualization
- AI analyzes top candidates and generates:
  - Compatibility scores
  - Key strengths and challenges
  - Visual charts summarizing fit across multiple dimensions
  - AI-generated summaries for each candidate
- **Interactive Dashboard** for HR teams:
  - Candidate-to-team compatibility scores
  - Key alignment areas
  - Potential risks & AI recommendations
  - Graphical representations of compatibility
