# Critical Features & Dependencies Map

This document outlines the essential features that must be implemented for a functional Teamwork Compatibility Checker, along with the dependencies between components.

## Core Feature Set

### 1. Team Management
- **Create Team**: Add a new team with basic information
- **Add Team Members**: Add members to a team
- **Team Questionnaire**: Collect work preferences from team members

### 2. Candidate Management
- **Create Candidate**: Add a new candidate with basic information
- **Candidate Questionnaire**: Collect work preferences from candidates

### 3. Compatibility Analysis
- **Calculate Compatibility**: Compare team and candidate profiles
- **Generate Insights**: Identify strengths and challenges

### 4. Results Visualization
- **Compatibility Score**: Display overall compatibility percentage
- **Dimension Breakdown**: Show scores for each dimension
- **Strengths/Challenges**: List key strengths and potential challenges

## Dependencies Between Components

```
[Database Models] → [API Services] → [API Endpoints] → [Frontend API Clients] → [React Components] → [User Interface]
```

```
[Team Member Responses] → [Team Profile Generator] → [Compatibility Calculator] → [Results Data] → [Visualization Components]
```

## Component Dependencies Table

| Component A | Depends On | Owner | Owner of Dependency |
|-------------|------------|-------|---------------------|
| Database Sessions | - | Person 1 | - |
| Database Models | Database Sessions | Person 1 | Person 1 |
| API Services | Database Models | Person 1 | Person 1 |
| Compatibility Service | API Services, AI Components | Person 2 | Person 1, Person 2 |
| API Endpoints | API Services | Person 2 | Person 1 |
| Frontend API Clients | API Endpoints | Person 3 | Person 2 |
| React Context | Frontend API Clients | Person 3 | Person 3 |
| Page Components | React Context, UI Components | Person 3 | Person 3, Person 4 |
| UI Components | - | Person 4 | - |
| Form Components | UI Components | Person 4 | Person 4 |
| Visualization Components | Chart.js, API Clients | Person 5 | Person 3 |
| Docker Configuration | All Components | Person 5 | All |

## Minimum Viable Product Definition

To ensure a functional demo within the 2-day timeframe, focus on these essential features:

### MVP Backend
1. **Team Creation API**: Create and manage teams
2. **Candidate Creation API**: Create and manage candidates
3. **Basic Questionnaire API**: Store and retrieve questionnaire responses
4. **Simple Compatibility Algorithm**: Basic calculation without AI enhancements

### MVP Frontend
1. **Team Setup Form**: Create a team and add members
2. **Candidate Entry Form**: Add candidate information
3. **Questionnaire Form**: Complete preferences questionnaire
4. **Basic Results View**: Simple visualization of compatibility scores

## Risk Management: Critical Path Analysis

The critical path (most time-sensitive sequence) is:

1. **Database Models** → **API Services** → **API Endpoints** (Backend Foundation)
2. **React Setup** → **API Clients** → **Basic UI** (Frontend Foundation)
3. **Compatibility Algorithm** (Core Logic)
4. **Results Visualization** (User-Facing Output)

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Early Integration**: Implement "vertical slices" of functionality early
- **Simplified Defaults**: Have fallback/default values for incomplete components
- **Mock Data**: Create sample data for testing even if real data flow is incomplete

## Communication Requirements

### Handoff Points:
1. **Person 1 → Person 2**: Database models to API implementation (End of Day 1 Morning)
2. **Person 2 → Person 3**: API endpoints to frontend clients (Mid-Day 1 Afternoon)
3. **Person 3 → Person 4**: Page layouts to UI component integration (End of Day 1)
4. **Person 2 → Person 5**: Compatibility data structure for visualization (Morning of Day 2)

### Recommended Sync Schedule:
- **9:00 AM**: Quick standup to discuss goals and blockers
- **12:00 PM**: Mid-day sync to verify morning progress
- **3:00 PM**: Alignment check for integration points
- **5:00 PM**: End-of-day review and planning for next day
